# Australia’s bushfires intensify its debate about climate change

THE FIRES eased over Christmas. But as 2020 neared, Australia’s inferno blazed anew. In the state of Victoria, thousands of people fled to the seashore on New Year’s Eve as bushfires ringed the coastal town of Mallacoota. Samuel McPaul, a volunteer firefighter, died earlier in neighbouring New South Wales when a “fire tornado”, as colleagues described it, overturned his vehicle. The federal government has called in military planes and ships to help evacuate people sheltering on beaches in both states. Experts say the fires are the most extensive in Australia’s history and are far from over. They have sparked heated debate about the impact of climate change and the government’s equivocal commitment to tackling it. 


圣诞节期间火灾减轻了。但是随着2020年临近，澳大利亚的地狱火又重新燃起。在维多利亚州，由于森林大火在沿海城镇马拉科塔（Mallacoota）响起，除夕夜，成千上万的人逃到了海边。志愿者消防员塞缪尔·麦克保罗（Samuel McPaul）较早时在邻国新南威尔士州去世，当时，正如同事们所描述的那样，一场“龙卷风”使他的车辆翻倒。联邦政府已召集军用飞机和船只帮助疏散两个州海滩上的避难所。专家说，大火是澳大利亚历史上最广泛的一场大火，还远远没有结束。他们引发了关于气候变化的影响以及政府对解决气候变化的明确承诺的激烈辩论。

New South Wales is the country’s most populous state and has suffered some of the biggest losses: 15 lives and about 1,300 homes. (Pictured is a house under threat in Lake Conjola.) The state’s bushfires have covered almost 40,000 square kilometres, nearly the area of Denmark. That is greater than the total area during the past three years’ fire seasons. These usually start in October, Australia’s mid-spring. In 2019 the fires began in July. A drought that started in eastern Australia three years ago had left plenty of dry fuel. On December 18th Australia as a whole had its hottest day on record, at 41.9°C. The fires have spread across the country, at one point closing the highway to the Nullarbor Plain that links Western Australia to the east coast. 

新南威尔士州是该州人口最多的州，遭受了最大的损失：15人丧生，约1300所房屋。 （图为Conjola湖中一处受到威胁的房屋。）该州的森林大火覆盖了近40,000平方公里，几乎是丹麦的面积。这比过去三年火灾季节的总面积还大。这些活动通常始于澳大利亚的仲夏十月。 2019年的大火从7月开始。三年前在澳大利亚东部开始的干旱留下了大量的干燃料。 12月18日，整个澳大利亚的气温最高，为41.9°C。大火已经蔓延到全国各地，有一次关闭了通往连接西澳大利亚州和东海岸的纳拉伯平原的高速公路。


In early December former fire chiefs called on the government to help organise an emergency meeting to discuss the growing threat of wildfires amid global warming. Scott Morrison, the prime minister, had different plans. He took his family on a holiday to Hawaii, without telling the public. After an outcry, and the deaths of two firefighters during his absence, he returned just before Christmas. But he rejected requests to change the approach his conservative Liberal-National coalition takes to climate change. 

12月初，前消防局长呼吁政府协助组织一次紧急会议，以讨论全球变暖带来的野火威胁。总理斯科特·莫里森（Scott Morrison）制定了不同的计划。他没有通知公众就带家人去夏威夷度假。强烈抗议之后，又有两名消防员在他缺席期间死亡，他于圣诞节前返回。但是他拒绝了改变保守派自由民族联盟对气候变化采取的态度的要求。


The government’s climate policy takes its tone from John Howard, a former Liberal prime minister, who once dismissed calls for action as “the latest progressive cause” and a “substitute religion”. As the fires took hold in November, Michael McCormack, the deputy prime minister, blamed “inner-city raving lunatics” for linking them to climate policy and Australia’s coal industry. Coal, a big source of carbon emissions, is Australia’s second-biggest export, and is used to generate almost two-thirds of its electricity. The coalition abolished a carbon tax imposed by the former Labor government. In place of this market-driven mechanism it set up a public fund worth A$3.5bn ($2.5bn), partly to pay polluters to cut emissions. 


政府的气候政策与前自由党总理约翰·霍华德（John Howard）息息相关，他曾将行动呼吁视为“最新的进步原因”和“替代宗教”。在11月发生大火时，副总理迈克尔·麦考马克（Michael McCormack）指责“城市狂欢狂人”将其与气候政策和澳大利亚的煤炭工业联系在一起。煤炭是碳排放的主要来源，是澳大利亚的第二大出口商品，其近三分之二的电力用于发电。该联盟取消了前工党政府征收的碳税。它建立了一个价值35亿澳元（合25亿美元）的公共基金，代替了市场驱动机制，部分目的是向污染者支付以减少排放。

Critics say such measures are inadequate. Greta Thunberg, a Swedish climate activist, cited the fires when tweeting criticism of Australia’s climate policy. Mr Morrison retorted that he was “not here to try and impress people overseas”. As the fires raged, some countries at a recent UN climate conference in Madrid grumbled about Australia’s apparent sleight of hand, involving the use of carbon credits linked to its emission-reduction targets for 2020 as a way of meeting its higher targets for 2030. Angus Taylor, the energy minister, argues that because Australia produces just 1.3% of global emissions, it “can’t single-handedly have a meaningful impact”. 

批评人士说，这样的措施是不够的。瑞典气候活动家格雷塔·滕伯格（Greta Thunberg）在推特上批评澳大利亚的气候政策时引用了大火。莫里森先生反驳说，他“不是来这里试图打动海外人民”。随着大火肆虐，最近在马德里举行的联合国气候会议上，一些国家对澳大利亚明显的狡猾gr之以鼻，其中涉及将与其2020年减排目标相关的碳信用额度用于实现其2030年更高目标的方式。能源部长泰勒认为，由于澳大利亚仅产生全球排放量的1.3％，因此“不能单方面产生有意义的影响”。

The fires are raising the temperature of Australia’s climate-change debate. Mr Morrison says climate change is just one of “many factors” behind the inferno. Greg Mullins, a former fire chief, retorts that these factors all relate to climate change. He and fellow ex-chiefs still plan to convene a meeting to discuss the problem, even if the government stays aloof. “We’ll invite the prime minister,” he says, wryly. Some business leaders also want the government to adopt a tougher climate policy. Peter Harmer, the head of IAG, an insurance firm, speaks of an “urgent need for Australia to prepare for and adapt to climate change”. With no end to the bushfires in sight, such calls are bound to grow. 

熊熊大火加剧了澳大利亚气候变化辩论的温度。莫里森先生说，气候变化只是地狱背后的“许多因素”之一。前消防局长格雷格·穆林斯（Greg Mullins）反驳说，这些因素都与气候变化有关。即使政府保持超然态度，他和前任总理仍计划召开会议讨论这一问题。 “我们将邀请总理，”他苦苦地说。一些商业领袖还希望政府采取更严格的气候政策。保险公司IAG的负责人彼得·哈默（Peter Harmer）谈到“澳大利亚急需为气候变化做准备和适应”。由于看不到丛林大火的尽头，这种呼声必将增加。
